# Scala + gRPC Server - Hello World

A GRPC Server application written in Scala to serve as a example application due to lack of documentation available for Scala+grpc.

Contains the following implementations:
 - Unary Calls (sayHello)
 - Client Side Streaming (clientStream)
 - Server Side Streaming (serverStream)
 - Bidirectional Streaming (streamHello)

Client Code coming soon.
